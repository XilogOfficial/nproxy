## What?
nproxy is a reverse proxy service that's intended to bypass ISP restrictions stopping you from hosting on port 80 or 443.

## How's it work?
You can specify the host IP, and we'll forward that site to a subdomain on our domain (like myawesomeballinwebsite.nproxy.org) at port 80.

## What's it cost?
Free for one proxy per user. Paid plans for more proxies coming soon.
