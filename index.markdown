## What?
nproxy is a reverse proxy service that's intended to bypass ISP restrictions stopping you from hosting on port 80 or 443.

## How's it work?
You can specify the host IP and port, and we'll forward that to our server's IP at port 80. You can then point your DNS over to our server.

## What's it cost?
Free for one proxy per user and up to 10 for paid. Paid plans for more proxies coming soon.
